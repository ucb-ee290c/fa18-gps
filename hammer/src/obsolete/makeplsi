# Entry point to PLSI that wraps the Makfile invocation to handle
# various loose ends (e.g. using pre-built tool binaries).

# PLSI_MAKEFLAGS should contain all extra arguments to make.
# This is required because some flags critical to PLSI like -o are not
# supported via MAKEFLAGS.

# PLSI_MAKEFILES is a list (string separated by spaces) of all the extra
# Makefiles to include via -f before running the main PLSI makefile.
